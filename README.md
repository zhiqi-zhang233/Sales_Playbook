## GitHub Collaboration Guide
### ✅ Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal (or VSCode terminal) and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/zhiqi-zhang233/Sales_Playbook.git
```
Then navigate into the project folder:
```
cd Sales_Playbook
```
### ✅ Step 2: Create and Switch to Your Own Branch
I’ve already created a branch for each of you. To check which branch you’re currently on:
```
git branch
```
The branch with a `*` is your current one.
To switch to your assigned branch:
```
git checkout your-branch-name
```
**Please make sure you’re always working on your own branch (not on main).**
### ✅ Step 3: Make Changes Locally
Edit or add files using VSCode. When you're ready to save your progress:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```
### ✅ Step 4: Push Your Branch to GitHub
```
git push origin your-branch-name
```
### ✅ Step 5: Create a Pull Request (PR)
1. Go to our GitHub repo:
👉 https://github.com/zhiqi-zhang233/Sales_Playbook
2. You should see a “Compare & pull request” button – click it.
3. Add a short description of your changes and click `Create pull request`.

This allows us to review and merge your work into the `main` branch.
